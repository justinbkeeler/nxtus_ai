They have such a wide variety of chocolates, baked goods, some delicious ice cream and sorbets as well.

$6 for Meican Chocolate is excessive, and it wasn't even great Mexican Chocolate. Honestly I had better and only paid $4 in CO last week,  and I was paying mountain prices. This one lacked the smooth velvety texture and the wonderful spices. Two stars because the shop has nice atmosphere and nice counter help.

Paid $30 for 9 tiny chocolates and a little cake pop. Figured hmmm these are pretty pricey so they must be amazing! NO! Literally the most disgusting chocolates I have ever had in my life. Had to spit out half because of how gross they were. They were nice to look at but I don’t recommend eating them.
